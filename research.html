<h2>Internet Research</h2>
<br>
<p>
There are forms of communication media; two of which are Analog and Digital. Analog includes conventional radio, telephonic, and television transmissions. Digital comprises of computer mediated communication, computer networking, and telegraphy. One advantage of digital data is that it can be easily compressed. One disadvantage of digital media is that sampling may cause loss of information. One advantage for analog is digital signals can convey information with less noise, distortion, and interference. One disadvantage is that a higher bandwidth is required for digital communication when compared to analog transmission of the same information. The purpose of health and safety is to protect your workers, sub-contractors, customers, and members of the public when they are involved with your business. Some safety lab practices are no Food or Drink, wear your Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), proper lab attire, good hygiene, and use proper storage containers. Some healthy work place practices are wearing clothing and shoes that cover exposed skin to protect you from potential splashes; for example, chemical spills. Tie back long hair, jewellery, or anything that may get caught in moving equipment. It is not advisable to eat food, drink beverages, chew gum, apply cosmetics or handle contact lenses the laboratories.
